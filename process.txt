You are an expert Python developer and data engineer.

I am a beginner who does not know how to code.

I want to build a simple Streamlit web app that does the following:
1. Allows users to upload CSV or Excel files
2. Displays the uploaded data in a table
3. Cleans the data by:
   - Removing duplicate rows
   - Handling missing values (fill empty cells with "N/A")
   - Trimming extra spaces from text
   - Standardizing column names (lowercase, replace spaces with underscores)
4. Allows users to download the cleaned file as CSV or Excel

Please:
- Write the full working Python code
- Use Streamlit and pandas
- Explain the code step by step in simple language
- Add comments in the code for beginners
